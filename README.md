# JunoSeedFinder

Seed finder used to generate a list of seeds for the Juno SMP minecraft server.
Made use of Kaptain Wutax's libraries

Special thanks to Wutax, Neil, Nnnik, and Matthew for sharing knowledge of seedfinding either over discord or from youtube. 

This version finds a QWH and double monuments near either the x axis or the z axis. This will be important for our server for reasons that will be shared later. This finder also finds mushroom islands and a pillager outpost near the axis as well.

We planned to add a slime finder and some additional tools to the final product but at the end of the day, it produced a seed we were happy with and so it was un-neccecary. 

In the end, we went through and handpicked out seed out of the results. The chosen seed was [INSERT HERE]. We narrowed them down by looking at the mesa biomes for quarries and also by looking at slime chunks near an axis. 

On my machine (i5-6400, 2.7ghz, 4cores) this program ran in about [INSERT TIME HERE] hours.
